(** Allow an application to log via the Apple System Log

The Apple System Log is intended to be a replacement for syslog on
OSX systems.

Example:

{[
  let client = Asl.Client.create ~ident:"example" ~facility:"Daemon" ~opts:[ `Stderr ] () in
  let message = Asl.Message.create ~sender:"example" () in
  Asl.log ~client message `Notice "hello, world!"
]}

For context, please read the following documents:

{ol
{li
{{:://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/asl.3.html}
Apple System Log man pages}
}
}
*)

type level = [
  | `Alert
  | `Crit
  | `Debug
  | `Emerg
  | `Err
  | `Info
  | `Notice
  | `Warning
]
(** Every message has an associated level, which is usually used for
    filtering. *)

module Client: sig
  type t
  (** A thread-unsafe client handle *)

  type opt = [
    | `Stderr (** Also log to stderr *)
    | `No_delay (** Connect immediately to the server *)
    | `No_remote (** Disables remote-control filter adjustment *)
  ]
  (** Client options *)

  val create: ident:string -> facility:string -> ?opts:opt list -> unit -> t
  (** Create a thread-unsafe client handle. *)

  val add_output_file: t -> Unix.file_descr -> string -> string -> level -> bool
  (** [add_output_file t fd msg_fmt time_fmt level_up_to] adds
      [fd] to the set of the file descriptors used by the client [t]. Each log
      message written via [t] will be written to [fd] if it has level
      [level_up_to] or above. See the ASL documentation for the meaning of [msg_fmt]
      and [time_fmt] strings. If successful, the function returns [true] and
      [false] otherwise. *)
end

module Message: sig

  type t
  (** A message provides context (keys, values, client ids etc)
      for individual logs *)

  type ty = [
    | `Msg (** a regular log message *)
  ]
  (** The type of the message *)

  val create: ?ty:ty -> ?time:string -> ?host:string -> ?sender:string
    -> ?facility:string -> ?pid:string -> ?uid:string -> ?gid:string
    -> ?level:string -> ?msg:string -> ?extra:(string * string) list
    -> unit -> t
  (** Construct a message, overriding some of the context.*)
end


val log: ?client:Client.t -> Message.t -> level -> string -> unit
(** Send a string to the logger with the given message context and level.

    Creating a client is optional. If none is provided then a default
    thread-safe client is used. Note the internal locks can cause
    extra contention between threads. Note also the only way to have
    logs printed to stderr is to construct and use a Client.t.
